# onkeypress=hack()

This is an extension of our talk [Evil Genius: Why you shouldn't trust that keyboard](https://github.com/mauroeldritch/evilgenius), where we emphasize the manufacture of manipulated hardware.

BadUSB devices and keyloggers are popular worldwide, and almost no one ignores their nature.

In this talk we have decided to go beyond the classic concept of a malicious USB stick or an odd-looking malicious adapter that begs not to be detected while copying keystrokes attached to the keyboard.

We part from a normal keyboard from a well-known brand available worldwide, which we disassemble to add our own hardware modification (our "hack").

This modification, which consists of cheap parts that can be acquired worldwide, makes this keyboard an interesting attack vector: a device that looks and functions as a keyboard, but is capable exfiltrate information online, connecting to a malicious server and sending keystrokes without being noticed. 

This hack was assembled in many models, from normal office keyboards to gaming equipment, getting smaller... and cheaper!
